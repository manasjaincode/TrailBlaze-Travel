🔍 Reality Check – Tech Edition
This project gives you a reality check about where you actually stand in the tech world.
It’s a fun, brutally honest (but lighthearted) roast — based on the categories you choose and the ratings you give yourself (out of 10, of course).

No sugarcoating. No filters. Just vibes and a mirror.

⚠️ We don’t store sh*t.
Yeah, we dgaf. That’s why there’s no database. No backend connections.
We’re not here to track you. We’re here to roast you for your own good.

💭 Final Thoughts
If you're honest with yourself while answering it, trust me —
you’ll end up learning something, and probably come out better in life and career.

Stay real. Stay raw. Get roasted.

( I built it coz I was mad bored yesterday )
